# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## The Purpose
### The purpose of this project was to analyze the data and see if there were any trends or correlations between funding, dates of programs launched, money aimed for/received, coutry of origin, etc. The goal was to find out the best time to launch a program and the best way and time to raise funds for the program.
## Challenges
### During this process challenges were faced head on. There was a lot of data to sift through and finding out what was pertinent was interesting. Although this project was laid out in a steo-by-step fashion, something similar to this might be overwhelming due to the amount of data. Some of the data was not important to the study and just took up space. Another challenge was ensuring the graphs were easy to read and relayed the proper information I wanted to convey.
## Conclusions
### Theater Outcomes
#### One of the most important takeaways for theater outcomes is the highest success rate is in the summer time. Secondly, The worst successrate and highest rate for failure is towards the fall and winter. 
### Outcomes Base on Goals
#### The most important takeway for outcomes based on goals is to note, the larger the goal, the lower the succes rate.
## Limitations
### There are limitations to discuss on the data set. It does not take into account outside factors such as weather and location. The weather could keep people from going to shows which is why the winter months have a lower liklihood of success. Nor does the data state anything aside from the country. So if the data was taken in Omaha, Nebraska vs, New York, New York, the data could be drastically different and ergo would possibly call for a different respose when analyzed.
